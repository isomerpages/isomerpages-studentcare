#### STORY 2: A SAFEGUARD AGAINST PREDATORS

John is 32 years old and he has intellectual disability. He is rather trusting and can easily be won over by anyone who treats him well. He is not able to hold a job and needs close guidance. When John’s mom, Mary found that she was terminally ill with stage 4 cancer, she asked Melissa, her church friend to look after John for her after she was no longer around. Knowing that they were without close kin or relatives, plus John’s father was estranged from the family; Melissa felt she couldn’t refuse a dying person’s request. Mary passed away soon after in Year 2009. Melissa became the executor of her will. Melissa does what she can for John as Mary had wished.  
  
Melissa immediately contacted the lawyer to settle Mary’s estate. Unfortunately as Mary was in arrears in payment to HDB, John could remain in their flat only till the end of the year. Melissa searched and found alternative accommodations for John in TOUCH Ubi hostel which provided accommodations for persons with special needs. However, John did not like staying in a sheltered hostel. On one occasion, John met Uncle Peter, the husband of his mother’s ex-classmate. He confided in Uncle Peter who readily invited John to stay with him. Before Mary’s demised, she had warned John specifically against Uncle Peter, yet John chose to stay with him.  
  
Melissa had many suspicions about Peter, but she could do little because John is very gullible. By pulling the wool over John’s eyes, Peter persuaded him to part with $118,000 (monies in fixed deposit held by John and his late mother) and also his mother’s CPF monies. Melissa was shocked when John told her that he had only $4 in his bank account. She immediately contacted the police. To her frustration, when John and Peter were called in for questioning, John told the police that he willingly lent Peter the monies and so the case was dropped. After the police incident, Melissa persisted and insisted that Peter return the monies to John in instalments. Sadly, the monies have not been fully recovered. Peter has defaulted many times and it has proven difficult to recover it.  
  
Unfortunately, Mary was not aware of the SNTC Trust when she was alive. If Mary had been able to set up a trust, John could have been prevented from losing his monies.

> “I urge all caregivers with people of special needs and low IQ to plan ahead for their future needs. Because what happen to John could possibly happen to their loved ones as well. People like John are vulnerable and easily manipulated and there are sharks out there. I never believed this until I met one, who heartlessly preyed on a trusting and vulnerable individual like John. I urged every caregiver to take action and plan ahead.”
