#### A FATHER’S HEART

Jolene has intellectual disabilities and her father, Mr Tan had always been on the lookout for an affordable solution to safeguard his daughter’s financial security and welfare. As a Financial Advisor with an insurance company, Mr Tan knows of private trust. However, their fees are too expensive for him and his family.  
  
When Mr Tan came to know of SNTC, he was delighted because SNTC is a not-for-profit organization with an Institute of Public Character (IPC) status, compliant to the Code of Governance for Charities. He is most happy with the SNTC Care Plan and Letter of Intent that are appended to the SNTC Trust. These enable him to write his instructions on the long term care for Jolene which includes her accommodations, education, medical needs and even expenses on her hobbies and leisure activities.  
  
Mr Tan appreciates the meetings with SNTC Case Manager to discuss Jolene’s needs in order to draw up and keep up-to-date a comprehensive care plan for the welfare of her future. This gives Mr Tan a sense of assurance as a Trust will prevent exploitation of his daughter and any possible loss of funds that he sets aside for Jolene. Also for the fact that SNTC continues these discussions with guardians after the demise of caregivers and the assurance of a Case Manager making home visits to check on the welfare of the dependents with special needs gives him peace of mind to know Jolene’s future is in good hands.

> “I am glad that SNTC has been set up and supported by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) to provide affordable trust service for persons with special needs. By volunteering with parent support groups, I often share my experience with caregivers. I believe by working and supporting each other, it is possible to take positive action to overcome challenges.”
