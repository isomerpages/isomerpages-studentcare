### Help us reach out to serve

Our heart is to serve caregivers and their loved ones with special needs. All the more so for senior caregivers as we are concern that they might pass on without making adequate arrangement to provide for the care and financial needs of their loved ones. We need your help to be our eyes to look out for them, and be our hands to reach out to them so that we can serve them.

If you know of anyone â€“ a caregiver or person with special needs who will benefit from our services, kindly tell them about SNTC or refer them to us.
