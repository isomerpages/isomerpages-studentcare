### **When you are a newly appointed SCFA Administrator**

The SCFA Scheme provides fee assistance for children from lower-income working1 families who enrol in SCFA Administrator Student Care Centres (SCCs). Under the SCFA Scheme, successful applicants are provided a monthly Subsidy and SUG (if eligible) which MSF disburses directly to the SCC. SUG Deposit (equivalent to one month’s fees) shall be held by MSF and disbursed to the SCC if the student withdraws without providing 1 month’s notice). The SCC deducts the Subsidy against the SCC monthly fees. The amount of the Subsidy is determined based on the monthly gross household/per capita income of the family. With effect from 1 January 2016, families with a gross Household Income of up to $4,000, or a gross Per Capita Income of up to $1,000 (for families with five or more family members) are eligible to apply for the Subsidy.
 
When you are successfully registered as an SCFA Administrator, you are required to:
           
* (a)  Verify and confirm that applicants meet the eligibility criteria for the SCFA Scheme and email application form and required supporting documents to MSF_Comcare_SCFA@msf.gov.sg ;
* (b)  Update any changes to your Centre’s contact details via written communication (e.g. Email) to the respective Student Care Officer;
* (c)  Provide updates on your centre’s monthly capacity, overall student care enrolment, number of students receiving SCFA subsidies at your SCC, and other required information via the 6-monthly returns form once every 6 months;
* (d)  Allow access to any officer authorised by MSF to inspect the SCC and examine relevant documents relating to the administration of the SCFA subsidies during such visits;
* (e)  Abide by the prevailing minimum standards as outlined in the registration form for SCFA administrators; and 
* (f)   Track the attendance of students attending your SCC. For students who do not meet the 50% attendance requirement for a particular month, your SCC is to refund the SCFA subsidies for that month within the next calendar month.
