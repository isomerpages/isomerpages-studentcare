### **What is the Special Needs Savings Scheme (SNSS)?**

The SNSS was developed by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) in partnership with the Central Provident Fund Board (CFPB) to enable parents to set aside CPF savings for the long term care of children with special needs. Under the SNSS, parents may nominate their loved one with special needs to receive a regular stream of fixed pay-outs upon the parentâ€™s demise.
