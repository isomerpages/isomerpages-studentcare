### **What is the Special Needs Savings Scheme (SNSS)?**

The SNSS was developed by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) in partnership with the Central Provident Fund Board (CFPB) to enable parents to set aside CPF savings for the long term care of children with special needs. Under the SNSS, parents may nominate their loved one with special needs to receive a regular stream of fixed pay-outs upon the parent’s demise.

### **How does the SNSS work?**

* At the point of nomination, parents can decide the amount of monthly payouts the child with special needs will receive upon their demise. 
* The minimum monthly CPF payout is $250 for each nominated child with special needs. Parents may decide on a higher quantum. 
* There is no minimum balance sign up for SNSS. However, a participating parent’s CPF savings upon his/her demise must be sufficient to support a year’s worth of payout. (For eg, a minimum monthly payout is S$250 x 12 months = S$3000). If, upon the parents' demise this condition is not met, the CPF savings will be disbursed as a lump sum to the nominee.
* Without the SNSS nomination, a deceased person’s CPF savings in the Ordinary, Special, Medisave and Retirement Accounts are distributed to their nominee(s) as a once-off lump sum payment in cash if he had made a Cash nomination. If the deceased person did not make any nomination, his CPF savings will be transferred to the Public Trustee for distribution to his family members in accordance with the intestacy laws or inheritance certificate (for Muslims).
* When the parent passes on, the nominated child with special needs, who qualifies for SNSS will receive these pre-determined monthly pay-outs until the deceased parent’s savings are exhausted.

**BOTH parents of an eligible child with special needs may apply for the scheme for the benefit of the same child.**
