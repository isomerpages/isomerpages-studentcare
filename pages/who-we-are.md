### **Student Care Centres**

Student Care Centres provide care and supervision to school-going children in the Primary to lower Secondary levels outside school hours. The centres provide the students a safe place to rest, where they can also receive support to develop physically, intellectually, emotionally, socially and morally.

Student Care Centres can be found in both schools and the community, and be run by commercial or voluntary welfare organisations. Centres will typically provide meals and homework supervision. Beyond that, there is a great variety of programmes among Centres, as each centre has the flexibility to provide programmes that best cater to the profile of its students. These include academic support programmes, outdoor and indoor play, character development programmes, as well as enrichment and recreational activities. Centres may also organise excursion trips and camps for children during the school holidays.

Student Care Centres can choose to register with the Ministry of Social and Family Development if they wish to administer government student care subsidies. Such centres agree to meet the Ministry’s minimum requirements on areas such as physical environment, health, safety, supervision and having a structured programme. The Ministry will audit these centres to ensure that they meet these requirements. You could read more about the minimum requirements here
 
### **Subsidies and Financial Assistance**

The government Student Care Fee Assistance (SCFA) scheme provides eligible families with subsidies for their children's student care fees. To qualify, families have to meet income and employment conditions, and their child must also be attending a Student Care Centre registered with MSF. The amount of subsidy will depend on the family’s household income and the fees charged by the centre. You may visit this link for more information.
