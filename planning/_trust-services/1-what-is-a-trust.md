### **What is a Trust?**

A Trust is a legal relationship in which an individual or institution (known as the Trustee) holds assets, subject to a legal obligation to keep or use the assets for the benefit of another (known as the Beneficiary).

### **What is a SNTC Trust?**

A SNTC Trust is a necessary infrastructure to ensure your loved one receives the gifts under your will, insurance and CPF savings nomination.

### **Why Set up a SNTC Trust?**

1. Safeguard your loved one’s welfare and financial security.
2. Rely on a Trustee who will always be well informed about the rights of persons with special needs.
3. When you want to avoid placing the legal and financial responsibilities of managing the monies on relatives or friends.
4. When you foresee that relatives or friends may move away, suffer ill health and cannot commit to the long term management of the financial affairs of your loved one.
5. Rely on a permanent professional body to manage and administer your money for your loved one.

2. Principal value of the trust funds is guaranteed by the Government.
